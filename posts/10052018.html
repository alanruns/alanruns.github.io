  <p>Hello there! Welcome to a blog chronicling my journey from 0 to 13! I had been talking about running a half marathon and getting into shape for a <em>very</em> long time. I think it took me just about a year of blowing hot air before I actually did it. And I did! I signed up to run a half marathon on September 30th of this year.</p>
  <p>So, here I am. Going into this, I want to write down and record as much as I can not only for myself to look back on, but for anyone who happens upon this blog. I hope you enjoy going on this journey as much as I enjoy writing it down. Just to be completely honest with you, that could be anywhere from a lot to a little.</p>
  <p>With Love,</p>
  <p>Alan</p>
